DigitalColor Meter for Mac OS X - Settings for the Web
======================================================

If you're in need of an eye dropper application in Mac OS X for web development you're in luck - [DigitalColor Meter](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/all.html#colormeter "DigitalColor Meter") works really well.

If you're like me, you'll find all of the options in the drop-down representing different color spaces confusing. For web development which one should you choose? The correct setting is "Display native values":

You'll also want to set the display values to be hexadecimal:

Happy web development!
