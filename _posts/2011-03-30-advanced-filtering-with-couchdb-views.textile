title: Couchdb - Filtering Views by Parts of a Complex Key

Recently I had to sort a CouchDB view based on date while filtering that view by user and status.

In CouchDB, I knew that sorting of view results is based upon the key. Therefore, I needed a way to filter by part of a complex key ( e.g. field1 and field 2 from [field1, field2, field3], which in my case would have been user and status from [user, status, date] ). But where do you go with a question like this if the internet doesn't want to play ball? IRC of course!

h2. Summary

You have to use @startkey=@ & @endkey=@ if you want to filter by part of a complex key. If you want to filter using just @key=@, all parts of the complex key must be specified or you will get a null result, as @key=@ is looking for an exact match.

Note that when filtering by part of the complex key, you can only filter by in-order combinations. For example, if you had @[field1, field2, field3]@ as a key, you could only filter by @[field1]@, @[field1, field2]@ or @[field1, field2, field3]@. You could not, for example, filter by @[field1, field3]@, as CouchDB would interpret the key you specified for @field3@ as the value to filter @field2@ by.

The syntax required to use @startkey=...&endkey=...@ when you want to filter on only part of a complex key is as follows:

Say we had a key like @[field1, field2, field3]@, and we wanted to filter on only @field1@ where @field1 = "123"@. Our url would look like:

@http://localhost:5984/database/_design/design_doc/_view/view_name?startkey=["123"]&endkey=["123",{}]@

Notice the @{}@ in the @endkey@. This is so that we get all values returned by the view between @null@ and @{}@, which for just about every case should be everything.
