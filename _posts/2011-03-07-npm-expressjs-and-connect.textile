Connect (the node.js middleware framework) recently updated to its 1.0 release. If you're using Express.js, you will need to update to Express.js version 2.x to be compatible with Connect version 1.x.

Notes:
* Connect 1.0 removed the following modules:
** cache (This cached everything, even dynamic content. Caused us quite a few problems)
** conditionalGet (e.g. 304 - Not Modified)
** staticGzip
** gzip (Apparently this was buggy. Yeah, we used it)
** lint
* Connect 1.0 renamed the following modules:
** staticProvider -> static
** bodyDecoder -> bodyParser
** cookieDeconder -> cookieParser
