Don't store stuff (like user details) in the *_users* database. It's a pain in the ass. See "this":http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.couchdb.user/12700 link.

I plan to store user details in another document in another database with a 1:1 mapping to the *_users* user document (as per the article above).
